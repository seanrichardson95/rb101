The result of the following statement will be an error:
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)

Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

> My answer:

This gives a TypeError, because you cannot add together an integer and a string.

To fix this, put 40 + 2 in #{}:
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"

Another way to fix this is to print the text portion, then puts the numbers:
print "the value of 40 + 2 is "
puts 40 + 2

puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40+2).to_s
