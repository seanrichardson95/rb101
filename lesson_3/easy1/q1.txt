What would you expect the code below to print out?
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers


> My answer:

[1, 2, 2, 3]
It prints this out because .uniq does not mutate numbers

> LS answer:
1
2
2
3

numbers.uniq returned a new Array object with unique elements, but it did not modify the numbers object.
Further, the puts method automatically calls to_s on its argument, and thatâ€™s why you see the output like above.

Additional note: had the last line been p numbers instead, the output would have been [1, 2, 2, 3]
because the p method automatically calls inspect on its argument, which gives a different formatting on the output.
Furthermore, we could have also done puts numbers.inspect and the output would have been the same as using the p method.
