The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?
numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)

> My answer:

numbers.delete_at(1) will delete the element at index 1, which is 2.
- After trying it in irb, it does delete 2, and mutates the caller, so
  numbers now equals [1, 3, 4, 5]. It also returns 2.
  
numbers.delete(1) will delete the number 1.
- After trying it in irb, it deletes the number 1, and mutates the caller.
  numbers now equals [3, 4, 5]. It also returns 1
