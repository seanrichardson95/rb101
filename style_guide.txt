Ruby Style Guide: https://rubystyle.guide/

1. Your text editor's tab function should be set to 2 spaces and indenting should be set to use spaces. This is really important, 
   and if you don't do this, it's a sure sign you're a new Ruby developer.

   
2. When you see the # sign at the beginning of a line, that means anything after it, on the same line, is a comment. Comments are
   used by programmers to leave notes for other programmers or themselves at a later point in time.

   
3. When you define or initialize a method, variable, or file, you should always use snake_case formatting. 
   snake_case formatting is created using all lower case letters and separating words with the underscore character.
   
  # Naming a file
  
  this_is_a_snake_cased_file.rb
  
  # Assigning a variable
  
  forty_two = 42
  
  # Defining a method
  
  def this_is_a_great_method
    # do stuff
  end

  
4. When you want to represent a value that will not change in your Ruby program, you define a constant variable, 
   often referred to as a constant. In Ruby, constants are denoted with all uppercase letters.
   
  # Constant declaration
  
  FOUR = 'four'
  FIVE = 5
  

5. When working with do...end blocks, prefer {} when the entire code expression fits on one line.
  # Multi-line vs single line
  
  [1, 2, 3].each do |i|
    # do stuff
  end
  
  [1, 2, 3].each { |i| # do stuff }
  

6. The last style convention you'll need to learn at this point is how to declare a class name. 
   When naming your classes you will use CamelCase formatting. CamelCase uses no spaces and capitalizes every word.

  # Class naming
  
  class MyFirstClass
  end
  
  class MySecondClass
  end
