1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

> Casual psuedo-code
Take two integer inputs
Return the summation of the integers

> Formal psuedo-code

START

# given int1 and int2
SET summation = int1 + int2

END



2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

> Casual psuedo-code

Given an array of strings called strings

-Set a variable to the result of the join method on the strings array
-Return the variable

> Formal pseudo-code

START

# Given array of strings, called strings

SET long_string = strings array with join() method used on it

PRINT long_string

END



3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

> Casual pseudo-code

Given an array of integers, ints

-Create an empty array called every_other
-Iterate through ints with a loop
-Within the loop, have an if statement which adds the array value if the index % 2 = 0


> Formal pseudo-code

BEGIN

# Given array of integers, ints

SET every_other = empty array
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < ints.length()
  IF iterator % 2 == 0
    SET to_be_added = ints at "iterator"
    Add to_be_added to every_other
  END
END

PRINT every_other

END
